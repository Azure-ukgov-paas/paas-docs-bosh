title: Job Lifecycle
---

There are several stages that each release job goes through during a deployment process:

1. release job and its dependent packages are downloaded and placed on a machine
1. [pre-start scripts](pre-start.html) run for all release jobs
	- (waits for all pre-start scripts to finish)
1. `monit start` is called for each process
1. monit will automatically restart processes that exited
1. `monit unmonitor` is called for each process
1. [drain scripts](drain.html) run for all release jobs
	- (waits for all drain scripts to finish)
1. `monit stop` is called for each process
